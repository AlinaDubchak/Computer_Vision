## What About

This task requires the application of knowledge related to digital modeling and processing of geometric objects in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) spaces. The first thing that will be mastered is the use of different coordinate systems (screen, object, and global) to create and describe digital geometric shapes. This will allow you to understand and operate with geometric objects in different contexts and coordinate systems.The second important aspect is the application of geometric methods to describe 2D and 3D objects. This includes using mathematical tools and algorithms to accurately define and manipulate geometric shapes.
Dynamic transformations skills such as scaling, shifting, rotating, and projecting are key to changing and correctly displaying objects in space. These transformations need to be realized with the help of matrices and scalars, which are the basis of computer graphics and numerical modeling.

_Task1_<br>
To synthesize mathematical models and develop a program script that
that implements basic 2D transformations on geometric primitives. To develop
use matrix operations and composite transformation technologies. Input.
the matrix of coordinates of the corners of a geometric figure must be extended.

_Operation:_<br>
movement -> rotation -> scaling

_Task2_<br>
Level II task - maximum 8 points.
Synthesize mathematical models and develop a program script that
realizes the basic operations of 3D transformations on geometric primitives: axonometric
projection of any type and cyclic rotation (animation) of a 3D graphic object around
any selected internal axis. Do not display the rotation trajectory. For development
use matrix operations. The input matrix of coordinates of the corners of a geometric figure
must be expanded.

_Shape dynamics:_<br>
The shape appears and disappears,
changes the color of the outline and fill.
