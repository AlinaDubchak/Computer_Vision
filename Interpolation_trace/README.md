## What About

This project will study and implement several important processes and technologies for working with digital vector and raster images.

1. The processes of synthesis and geometric transformations of 2D and 3D digital vector images, as well as technologies for removing invisible lines and edges will be implemented. This will ensure accurate and efficient representation and manipulation of geometric objects.

2. It will implement vectorization of 2D and 3D geometric objects using approximation, interpolation, and smoothing methods, such as Lagrange polynomial, spline interpolation, BÃ©zier curves, and least squares. This allows you to create accurate vector representations of complex geometric shapes.

3. Digital raster images will be processed to extract contours through vectorization to identify selected objects. This will help to detect and recognize objects based on their geometric contours.

4. Software scripts will be developed to implement vectorization technologies, remove invisible lines and edges, and identify objects by their geometric shape or contour. This will ensure the automation and efficiency of these processes.

5. Learn the functionality and practical application of Matplotlib, NumPy, PIL, OpenCV, and Scipy libraries. These libraries provide powerful tools for working with graphics and numerical computing.
