> Oblective:
> To identify, study and generalize the features of the implementation of rasterization algorithms
> digital images on the example of applying rasterization algorithms, building complex
> 3D raster objects and the use of technologies for correcting the color characteristics of individual
> raster digital images.

## What About

In this project, you will learn important skills for working with digital geometric shapes and raster images. First, you will learn how to use screen, object, and global coordinate systems to create and describe 2D and 3D geometric shapes. This will help you understand how to properly place and manipulate objects in different coordinate systems. The next step is to learn how to rasterize 2D and 3D geometric objects, which will allow you to convert vector images to raster images. You will also learn how to work with raster images, study color models and methods of color correction at the pixel level. This will include working with raster image files to understand their structure and processing methods. In addition, the results of calculations will be visualized to help analyze and present data. Verification of the developed scripts will ensure their accuracy and reliability, which is important for creating reliable software.Finally, the functionality of important libraries for image processing and numerical calculations, such as Matplotlib, NumPy, PIL, will be introduced, as well as basic knowledge of OpenCV. These tools are powerful tools for implementing and testing various graphical and computational tasks, which will allow you to create complex image processing and graphics projects.

_Task1_<br>
Implement the development of a software script that implements color correction of digital
raster image from the list: change of brightness, shades of gray, negative, serpentine - in
gradients: diagonal (any direction); from the center; to the center. The processing is implemented at the
at the level of the raster matrix.
